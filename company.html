            The idea behind Appknox was triggered by the discovery that
            majority of the apps in the app stores were vulnerable to
            security issues. While hackers were exploiting the open source
             Android operating system to find vulnerabilities and
            inject malware, security issues in iOS apps were not too far behind.

      <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6">
        <p class="text-justify medium-font">
          This led to the idea of building a tool to help
          app owners secure their apps.
          The company founded by Harshit Agarwal, Subho Halder and
           Prateek Panda has found over 1,000 threats and audited over 900
          applications, including the ones developed by Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Skype, Yahoo and PayPal.
